# Platform One Technical Oversight Committee (P1TOC)
*NOTICE the P1TOC is in alpha and is not yet ready for widespread contributions. In the meantime you are welcome to submit an [issue](https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/p1toc/-/issues/new)*

P1TOC is the technical governing body of Platform One and maintainers of community engagements and contributions. While it doesn't map one to one, we are inspired heavily by the [CNCF TOC](https://github.com/cncf/toc); anything you see there is consistent with the outcome we'd like to see here.

\~The P1TOC scale contributions by the DoD technical and user community, while retaining integrity and increasing quality in support of our mission. ([source](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/sigs/README.md))

As we begin and evolve:
- We desire to enable community partnerships across organizations
- We desire to Enable colalborative developer of solutions, solving problems for the majority
- We are not here to gatekeep, instead to connect and collaborate
- We are not a standards body
- We are not an avenue to get funding, nor influence funding
