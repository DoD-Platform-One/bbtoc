# Big Bang Technical Oversight Committee (BBTOC)

BBTOC is the open collaboration body of the Big Bang ecosystem. We are heavily inspired by the [CNCF TOC](https://github.com/cncf/toc); anything you see there is consistent with the outcome we'd like to see here.

\~The BBTOC scale contributions by the DoD technical and user community, while retaining integrity and increasing quality in support of our mission. ([source](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/sigs/README.md))

Chief Objectives:

- Enable community collaboration across organizations and use cases
- Enabled collaborative development of solutions, solving problems for the majority
- We exist to connect and collaborate, not gatekeep and control
- We are not a standards body, nor do we influence funding of various efforts
