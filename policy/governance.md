# Members

TOC membership exists formally and organically to add value to the ecosystem, its collaboration, and success. Members are noted in the [TOC Readme](../README.md). In addition to membership, certain roles are established to ensure progress. Finally, the entire TOC is a living organism, including governance and policy on membership; changes and suggestions should be brought up immediately via a new issue and discussed at the earliest opportunity.

## Requirements

All members must adhere and agree to the following:

- The TOC [Working Agreement](../WORKINGAGREEMENT.md)
- An organization should only have a single member on the TOC at any given time
- Members must represent the best interests of the community without unchecked vendor bias
- Member nominations are approved by the BBTOC
- Member must be willing to support package and stack proposals as a Shepherd

### Roles

- Chair: up to two appointed member(s) will be nominated and designated chair/co-chair for a 6 month duration. The chair/co-chair is responsible for keeping the ship afloat, hosting meetings, keeping minutes, timeboxing, agenda, backlog management, etc...
- Voting Members: DoD employee or appointed individual representing a DoD project/program office who retain voting privileges on SIG creation, member nominations, package promotion, and Big Bang Backlog Prioritization
- Shepherd: for each proposed project/conformant stack a shepherd will be assigned. The shepherd is responsible for supporting engagement and interaction with the TOC, to include ensuring consistent and correct submissions, answering questions, and bringing topics before the TOC when appropriate; but is not responsible for the success of the submission.

## Issue Management

The TOC is open to all and anyone is asked to submit [issue](https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/bbtoc/-/issues/new) for any feedback, suggestion, comments, modifications, etc... To keep the process clean and progress flowing, we will follow these guidelines around issues:

- Issues will be marked as stale after 1 month of inactivity
- Stale issues will be closed after 2 weeks of inactivity
- Issues may be reopened for valid reasons
