## Unique Scenarios

Unknown scenarios will always pop up, acquisitions, contracts, employment changes, etc... 
- Membership should first and foremost provide dynamic representation across the community, without vendor bias.
- Second, the P1TOC should alwasy avoid interruption, even if this means breaking the 'rules' for a short period of time.

Resolution of such unique scenarios should be addressed above all other agenda
- The chair will be responsible for bringing this up at the next gathering
- The P1TOC must agree upon a path forward
- The path forward, must resolve the unique scenarios within 90 days
