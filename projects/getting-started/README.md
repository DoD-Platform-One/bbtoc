# New Projects

Have an idea or improvement, you're in the right place. Before proceeding please:
- Review the P1TOC [Working Agreement](/WORKINGAGREEMENT.md)
- Review Active [projects](/projects/) in `sandbox`, `incubating`, and `graduated` to ensure you're idea isn't related.
- Review [archived projects](/projects/archived) and ensure your idea has matured beyond the initial reasoning for archival.
- If you have an idea and aren't quite ready for a formal proposal, start by creating a [new idea issue](TODO)
- Review and meet the requirements of [Sandbox Projects](../../../process/README.md#Sandbox-Projects)

## New proposals

1. Submit a new [issue](https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/p1toc/-/issues/new), using the new project proposal template.
   1. The P1TOC will grant permissions so that you can proceed to step 2.
   2. the P1TOC will assign a Shepherd to your project. [Shepherd Role](../../../policy/governance.md)
2. Create a branch tied to the issue and complete the [proposal template](proposal_template.yaml)
3. When ready submit a pull request. The request will be reviewed at the next P1TOC meetup (time permitting, reviewed in order of submission).
   1. Make sure to copy the proposal template and rename it to \<your-project-name\>.yaml
   2. Title the merge request `Your-Project-Name proposal (#X)` where X is the issue number from step 1.
