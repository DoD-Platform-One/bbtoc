# New Projects

Have a new package to be added to the TOC? You're in the right place.

## Quick Start

1. Submit a `new project proposal` [issue](https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/bbtoc/-/issues/new)
2. Submit a Merge Request with your completed  [proposal template](proposal_template.yaml)


### The Details

1. When you submit a `new project proposal` issue...
   1. The TOC will assign you a Shepherd. The shepherd is your helper for any and all things you to get engaged with the TOC. [Shepherd Role](../../../policy/governance.md)
2. Populate the [proposal template](proposal_template.yaml) on a new branch (ask your shepherd if you need help) and place it into the 'new-submissions' directory. The template helps guide us and get you started efficiently.
3. The 'RepoURL' should be the repo1 (or Big Bang package) repository URL 
4. Once a Merge request is created and the "Draft" tag has been removed, that is a signal to the TOC Chair to add it to the agenda for the next meetup.

The TOC is not here to gatekeep projects, instead...  
We want to advocate and help maximize collaboration.   
We want to guide projects through the process of classification, sandbox to incubating to graduated.
