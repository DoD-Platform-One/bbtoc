# Proposals

- Review the P1TOC [Working Agreement](/WORKINGAGREEMENT.md)
- Review Active [projects](/projects/active/) and ensure you're idea isn't related.
- Review Completed [projects](/projects/completed/) and ensure you're idea isn't related. 
- Rejected [proposals](/projects/rejected/) and ensure you're idea isn't related or addresses the "rejected reasoning".

## New proposals

1. Submit a new [issue](https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/p1toc/-/issues/new), using the new project proposal template.
2. Wait for the P1TOC to grant access and/or provide initial feedback. (This will be done offline through comments on the issue)
3. Create a branch, complete the [proposal template](proposal_template.yaml), when ready submit a pull request. The request will be reviewed at the next P1TOC meetup (time permitting, reviewed in order of submission).

### Proposal reviews

   1. Proposer takes actions and solicits community advocacy
2. At the second P1TOC meetup, final review of submissions.
   1. The P1TOC moves the proposal to active or rejected
   2. A project kickoff meeting is established with a P1TOC member and the proposers.
3. At the kickoff meeting
   1. A meetup cadence is established, no less than once per week, timeboxed to less than 60m
   2. A general project timeline is established
   3. Code repository is clearly identified and includes a `CONTRIBUTING.md` created by the proposer.
4. Development iterates
5. When ready the project requests a project presentation by submitting an [issue](https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/p1toc/-/issues/new), using the project presentation template.
