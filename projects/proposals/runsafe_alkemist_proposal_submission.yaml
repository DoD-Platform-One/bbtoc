    description: Add RunSafe Alkemist protections to PlatformOne C++ pipeline templates
    problemStatement: As part of an AFWERX SBIR worked with SkiCAMP, RunSafe Security has added memory-based protections to their C++ pipelines. Upon completion of that task, both parties saw the P1 C++ templates as a great opportunity for adding these same protections to any C++ project that opts in.
    mvpMilestone:
        description: P1 C++ templates (https://code.il2.dso.mil/platform-one/devops/pipeline-templates/-/blob/master/jobs/build/cpp.yml) updated to include Alkemist dependencies and one-line build wrapper. First projects tested.
