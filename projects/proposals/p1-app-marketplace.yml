    repo url: "N/A"
    problemStatement: "An abundance of application development efforts across the DoD makes it challenging to find existing projects that meet local unit requirements. Whether seeking to contribute or simply consume, interested parties are usually best served by canvasing public forums to see if anyone knows about something they are looking for.  This method is lacking, however, because there is no guarantee your post will be seen by the right people and is heavily reliant on the interaction of others."
