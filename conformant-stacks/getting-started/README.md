# New Conformant Stacks

Have a new conformant stack to be added to the TOC? You're in the right place.

## Quick Start

1. Submit a `new stack proposal` [issue](https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/bbtoc/-/issues/new)
2. Submit a Merge Request with your completed [proposal template](proposal_template.md)

### The Details

1. When you submit a `new stack proposal` issue...
    1. The TOC will assign a shepherd. The shepherd is responsible for validating your stack against the [conformance criteria](../../../policy/conformance.md) and assisting in the process (providing access to submit MRs, etc).
1. On a new branch (ask your shepherd if you need help), create a new directory under `conformant-stacks`, named with the name of your stack.
1. Copy and populate the [proposal template](proposal_template.md) under your new directory. The template requires you to check each box for each requirement and provide an explanation/evidence of how your stack adheres to the requirement.
1. Create a merge request. Once your MR is opened and moved out of draft, that is a signal to the TOC Chair to add it to the agenda for the next meetup.
1. Once approved, the conformant stack source code will be mirrored to Repo1.
