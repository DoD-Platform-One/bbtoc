# Special Interest Groups (SIGs)

Special Interest Groups exist to provide focused topics for the Big Bang ecosystem to collaborate within. Inspired by [CNCF SIGs](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2019/09/12/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-application-delivery-sig/#:~:text=CNCF%20SIGs%20oversee%20and%20coordinate,and%20supported%20by%20other%20contributors.) 

## Governance

The SIGs are separated into two groups, Core SIGs and Big Bang Configurations SIGs. The BBTOC selects the SIGs, anyone can [propose](#proposing-new-sigs) additional SIGs. The BBTOC will rotate SIG discussions at meetups (i.e. Meetup n: Infrastructure, Meetup n+1: Kubernetes Distribution, etc...). Each SIG should have one chairperson to coordinate and organize activities. 

### Core SIGs

Core SIGs are focused on the full delivery of Big Bang from nothing to Day 2 operations.

- **Infrastructure**: focused on everything before 'cluster up'. How do groups provision infrastructure on cloud providers, on premise? What base images are used, are they STIGed?
- **Kubernetes Distribution**: focused on the Kubernetes flavor used to run Big Bang. 
- **Cybersecurity**: focused on the secure development, deployment, operations, and accreditation of Big Bang.
- **Airgap Delivery**: focused on the declarative packaging and delivery of Big Bang across air gap environments.

### Big Bang Configurations

Big Bang Configuration SIGs are focused on specific use cases of Big Bang.

- **Big Bang Core**: focused on packages required for Big Bang continuous operability in an accredited environment.
- **Continuous Delivery**: focused on packages in Big Bang used for Continuous Delivery of mission capabilities. (i.e. code storage, pipeline execution, image storage, etc...)
- **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**: focused on Big Bang packages used in AI/ML use cases.

## Proposing new SIGs

1. Review [Core](#core-sigs) and [Big Bang Config](#big-bang-configurations) SIGs to ensure no duplication of effort.
2. Submit a [new issue](https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/bbtoc/-/issues/new) using the 'New SIG' issue template
3. Join BBTOC meetups and be engaged with the issue's progress through the backlog.
