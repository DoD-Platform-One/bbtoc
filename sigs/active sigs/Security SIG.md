# Security SIG

- Focus: Security. Initially security isolation
- Chairperson: Blake Burkhart (@blake.burkhart)
- Meeting Schedule: TBD
- Meeting Link: TBD

## Overview

There is shared interest within the BB TOC in exploring new ways to increase the overall security of BB clusters. The current topic of security isolation is relevant to many BB personas: multi tenant clusters, clusters that execute untrusted code and users seeking very high security assurance. The SIG will identify security topics of shared concern and then will collaborate to evaluate or develop solutions. The SIG may create optional BB packages to address security issues or will recommend to the BB TOC improvements to the BB baseline.
